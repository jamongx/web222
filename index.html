        <h2>1. What is Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) protocol?</h2>
<p>The TCP/IP protocol has been discussed and standardized in the IETF. RFC 793 is the based standard for TCP, but it doesn't include all the details about modern TCP operations.</p>
  <p>TCP is a transport layer protocol that provides all the features that a general process requires for reliable data transmission through an unstable and unreliable network.</p>
  <p>It provides addressing for a process (application) in the form of TCP ports and allows devices to use these ports for the purpose of establishing connections between them. It is the most significant feature as a transport layer.</p>
 <p> When a connection is established between devices, they can exchange data between the devices with flow control and error control mechanisms simultaneously.</p>
<p>Finally, a process can send data bytes to TCP as a simple stream, and TCP deals with packaging and sending the data as segments.</p>
